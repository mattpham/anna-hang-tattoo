        <h2>Meet the Artist</h2>
        <p>
          Anna Hang was born and raised in Vietnam. She discovered her passion
          for art at a very young age. As far as she can remember, she loved to
          paint and draw. As a child, she participated in many art exhibitions
          and won many awards for her artwork. Over the years, she constantly
          worked on her artistry and dreamt of becoming a famous painter one
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, poor economic circumstances in her homeland caused her
          to put her artwork aside to join the family business. Though she felt
          financially responsible to support her family, as a true artist, she
          was unable to forget about her passion. She studied make up art,
          floral arranging, and fashion design to satisfy her creative interests
          and skills. Yet there was always a yearning for more, and to find a
          profession that she truly loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          After she married, Anna Hang was able to financially support herself
          and with her husbandâ€™s encouragement, began to study tattoo art with
          the Department of Tattooing Art in Vietnam. She soon realized how much
          she loved tattooing, even more than painting. She was one of the first
          female government certified Tattoo Artist at that time. From there,
          she started a tattoo shop next to her home, and through her
          workmanship and talent, became one of the most popular tattoo artists
          in Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2010 Anna Hang and her husband, Peter, have been running a
          successful tattoo shop in Orange County. Her professional success
          shows in customer satisfaction, the many referrals she has received
          from her colleagues and clients, and thousand of miles her clients
          travel to work with her.
